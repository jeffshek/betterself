selectedSupplementsCorrelations

# When in doubt of singular versus plural, just pick plural, so lean toward plural
UserActivitiesEvents

# when comparing things like Sleep and Supplements, pick the resource that's closest to the page first
# so if you're on sleep.js
sleepSupplementsCorrelations

# or if you can ... remove sleep from the name altogether (if you're in the sleep folder)
supplementsCorrelations (does this sound better with supplementCorrelations) instead?

# try to put data near the end of variables
historyChartData

# try to call the javascript files that just hold abstract classes
base.js

# try to make correlations plural
SleepSupplementsCorrelationsTests

# try to have aggregates/averages come after the resource
